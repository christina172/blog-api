# blog-api
Blog API Project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, Node.js Course, APIs)

This Blog API projects includes two routers for two different front ends: one is for the visitors to view the posts and leave comments (index router) and the other is for the author to write new posts, edit or delete exsisting ones and delete comments (myblog router). The routes of the second router are protected. The authentication and authorization are implemented with the help of the JWT (passport.js jwt strategy). 
This project along with the frontend websites is the implementation of the REST API principles. It is also my first full-stack project that doesn't use a view engine. The project was focused on connecting the back end with the front end - setting up the API and accessing it from the outside.
